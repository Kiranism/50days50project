After going through some javascript basics tutorials I'm looking ahead to do Brad Traversy #50days50projects Challenge. Brad recently launched a tutorial in udemy with 50 javascript projects with some basics of HTML and CSS.
I hope building projects will gain some more knowledge of javascript.
So lets gets started ðŸš€ ðŸ¥³
